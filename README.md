# BrickBreakerGame
Using Java Swing and with the inspiration by lerning some game coding from BroCode Youtube https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez, I tried to create this game on my own.
With codes learnt from Snake Game and Pong Game, I tried to create Brick Breaker using thread to run the game and bricks, paddle and balls created using Java Shapes.
Finally, movement of the objects were either random, predefined or through key event action listener.
